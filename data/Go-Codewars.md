# Codewars

Codewars is an interactive programming training resource that covers a great many languages, including Golang, and is an excellent way to improve your coding skills. This task will cover signing up to Codewars, selecting your desired languages (must include Go), and completing your first _kata_, or task. 

## Signing up to Codewars

- Head to [https://codewars.com](https://codewars.com)
- Click the 'Sign Up' link in the top right corner
- Here, you will be asked to select a language to begin with, select Go.
- To continue, you will now be required to solve the reason why the function does not work. If you have completed the previous Go tasks, you should have no issues here.
- Next you will supply your details, and it is effectively a standard signup form. You will also be given the opportunity to select more from the cadre of supported languages, and while it is definitely recommended to use Codewars outside of these tasks and select any languages that interest you, definitely keep Go selected.

## Completing your first Kata

- To get used to how Codewars functions, once logged in, click the search icon on the left and search for the string "Convert boolean values to strings", and click the Kata titled "Convert boolean values to strings 'Yes' or 'No'". Alternatively, head straight to the Kata [here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53369039d7ab3ac506000467)
- Click the '|> Train' button in the top right
- You now need to complete the function on the right, `BoolToWord`, to return a "Yes" or a "No" based on the input. You can also see the test setup in the bottom right window.
- Use the Test button as you go to run your code. Output is shown in the left, under the Output tab.
- Once your code is passing the tests (of which in other Kata you may be required to write as well, or you may want to tweak to be extra sure), use the Attempt button, bottom right also, to test your code against a more comprehensive set of test cases.
- Once your code passes the full test suite, you can click Submit to submit your solution.
- Once your solution is submitted and analysed, you will see feedback on how you've done. Please take the time to work out what this screen is telling you, there is quite a bit of useful information here. In particular, take note of the information shown while Show Me: "All Solutions" is selected versus "My Solutions".

## Submission for this task

Rather than putting code somewhere and zipping it up and sending it, for anything in Codewars, of which there will be a few tasks, just submit a screenshot of the solution page showing your solutions (as opposed to "All Solutions").
