# Linting

lint, or a linter, is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.

See [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-linting-and-how-can-it-save-you-time/) for more information.

## Linting for Go

Linting for Go source code is unfortunately not as straight forward as in other languages. The original, simle Go linter, [github.com/golang/lint](https://github.com/golang/lint), is unfortunately deprecated. Nevertheless, it is a good place to start. Have a look at the previous link, follow the installation instructions, and attempt to run it against the code from the previous Go tasks.

## Gofmt

Gofmt is a program to help style Go code in a consistent manner. Head to [https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/](https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/) and read up on how to use it, and apply it to the code from the previous tasks in the Go module.
